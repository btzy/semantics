            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Bernard Teo! I'm a software engineer who is particularly interested in programming language
                design and optimisation, and generally in how complex parts come together to form a coherent whole.
                Semantics is my personal blog about software engineering, primarily focused on C++.</p>
            <p>I currently work as a C++ software engineer at Hudson River Trading. (However, the content of this blog
                is my own and may not agree with the views of my employer.)</p>
